## Photoshop Handbook

Discussed at the [Style & Class Meetup](http://meetup.com/styleandclass) on March 11th, 2014 this Photoshop handbook has three benefits: 

- improve onboarding efficiency for new designer hires 
- smoothen the handoff between multiple designers working on the same project/files 
- help our developers find the right things quicker when diving into PSD comps
